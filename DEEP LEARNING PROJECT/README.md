# Image Classification Project (TensorFlow)

## Overview
This project implements a CNN-based image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Features
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Data preprocessing & normalization
- Training & evaluation
- Visualization of accuracy, loss, and sample predictions

## Setup & Run
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python image_classification.py
```
3. Results (accuracy/loss curves and predictions) will be displayed.
